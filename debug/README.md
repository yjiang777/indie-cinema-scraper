# Debug Scripts

These scripts were used to investigate the HTML/API structure of each theater website during development.

## Usage

Each script inspects a specific theater's website structure:

- `debug_new_beverly.py` - New Beverly Cinema HTML structure
- `debug_laemmle.py` - Laemmle Theatres date-based pages  
- `debug_american_cinematheque.py` - American Cinematheque API discovery
- `debug_revival_houses.py` - Revival Houses aggregator site

## Running Debug Scripts
```bash
python debug/debug_laemmle.py
```

These are **not required** for normal operation - they're documentation of the scraper development process.
